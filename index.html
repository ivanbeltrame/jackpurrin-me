            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>This website was made by a nerdy and bored high school student. I spend most of my time programming and learning. Inside and outside of school.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are music and programming. I used to play Minecraft and other games, but I don't play very many games anymore.</p>
            <p>I love Linux (arch specifically). I am a huge privacy nerd, and just like a nerd in general. Or at least that's what my friends tell me.</p>
            <p>I'm thinking about working in cybersecurity or web development. I might start a IT business though.</p>
            <a href="about">Here more about me and this website in my about page.</a>
