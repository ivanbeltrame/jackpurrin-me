i'm a high school student who like to program and write stuff. i've made many websites and other things. 

i don't quite know my sexuality and things yet, [but i start dating this girl!!](https://jackpurrin.me/posts/dating/) 

i play a lot of minecraft and half-life but my free time is usually spent on github, or random websites such as uquiz. 

i listen to lots of different music. i am big on hip hop, rap, and indie. some of my top artists are mac demarco, mf doom, and others.

i want to be a offensive cybersecuity enginner for a living
