    <h3>this website</h3>
    <p>this website actually started in 2023 when i was in 8th grade. i made this website under the domain jackpurrin.rf.gd (which is now down) and i hosted it using <a href="https://www.infinityfree.com/"></a>infinityfree.</p>
    <p>i just had this website so me and my friends had a place to play games and chat to each other with. i had build my own chat room, but as the year went on it became useless. besides that, my website was great and we all had a great time!</p>
    <p>this year in my 9th grade year, github gave me plenty of benifits fot being a high school student and it also came with a free .me domain. by that time, this website became less about me and my freinds and more about what i wanted it to be.</p>
    <p>before it looked quite barren, then it became more "modern" and now i want it to have an early internet astetic. like the <a href="https://geocities.org/">geocities</a> aesthetic! i just love this aesthetic and that's what my website is all about. 
    <p>thanks for reading!</p>
