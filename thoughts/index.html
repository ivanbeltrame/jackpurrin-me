    <p>this week has been shit if i'm being honest. my twin brother got kicked out of my old school. that school was awesome, and i loved it. now i'm locked into this other school that is making me retake a bunch of the classes i have taken and have credits for. then i'm forced to take choir. my old school was a block schedule and my new one is a yearlong. so classes i haven't taken in my old school such as biolgy, im dropping in the middle of. then i also have to take summer school to clean up the missing info from not taking semester one.</p>
