            <h2>About Me!</h2>
            <p>This website was made by a nerdy and bored high school student. I spend most of my time programming and learning. Inside and outside of school.</p>
            <p>My hobbies are music and programming. I used to play Minecraft and other games, but I don't play very many games anymore.</p>
            <p>I love Linux (<a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a> specifically). I am a huge privacy nerd, and just like a nerd in general. Or at least that's what my friends tell me.</p>
            <p>I'm thinking about working in cybersecurity or web development. I might start a IT business though.</p>
            <p>Some other things about me</p>
            <p>My favorite color is pink (if you couldn't tell already)</p>
            <p>My favoirte pet are cats. I love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat">Tortoiseshell cats</a>.</p>
            <p>I am bisexual</p>
            <p>My favorite instrument is the guitar</p>
            <p>Also, if you're reading this honey; i miss and love you!</p>
            <h2>About this website!</h2>
            <p>I've had this website for almost a year. Been hosted on places like <a href="https://www.infinityfree.com/">InfinityFree</a> and Github. Been mostly hosted on Github.</p>
            <p>I have all the code on <a href="https://github.com/jackpurrin/me">Github</a> currently. My domain was also provied partially by Github.</p>
            <p>I am a student, so I took advantage of the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github Education Pack</a> and <a href="https://nc.me/">NameCheap</a> gave me a free domain for being a student.</p>
            <p>The domain is protected and managed by <a href="https://cloudflare.com.">Cloudflare</a>.</p>
            <p>Cloudflare also builds and publishes my website. I use the <a href="pages.dev">Cloudflare Pages</a> feature in Cloudflare to deploy my website</p>
