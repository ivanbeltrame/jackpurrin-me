    <h1>about this website</h1>

    <p>this website actually started in 2023 when i was in 8th grade. i made this website under the domain jackpurrin.rf.gd (which is now down) and i hosted it using infinityfree. i just had this website so me and my friends had a place to play games and chat to each other with. i had build my own chat room, but as the year went on it became useless. this year in my 9th grade year, github gave me plenty of benifits fot being a high school student and it also came with a free .me domain. by that time, this website became less about me and my freinds and more about what i wanted it to be. before it looked quite barren, then it became more "modern" and now i want it to have an early internet astetic. like the <a href="https://geocities.org/">geocities</a> aesthetic i just love this aesthetic and that's what my website is all about. thanks for reading! </p>
